# Raccoon Photo App

Here's a very small project built for a course on freeCodeCamp.org. The main goal here was to introduce flexbox and the way it works (one dimensional container, main axis and cross axis, flexible items, etc) but the funny thing is i did three importants discoveries that have absolutely nothing to do with flexbox:

1. the 'box-sizing' CSS propertie CANNOT be inherited. I use that property on a daily basis and i never even noticed...
2. i learned about the 'object-fit' CSS propertie and it felt like finally getting an answer to so many of my images'layout problems. I'll definitely remember that one!
3. raccoons are adorables! A big thank you to all artists giving some of their works on https://unsplash.com/

That being said and even if the project was small &sol; very simple i really enjoyed it because i felt like i learned a ton for what little work i produced (it was also a good opportunity to test media queries). For all futures projects, i'll try to be more concise and focus on what was asked, what was done and what was learned. Seems like a good way to reflect on each project and use them to grow as a developper.
